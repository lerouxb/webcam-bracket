# webcam-bracket
A bracket for mounting a Logitech C310 (or other) webcam to a Printrbot Simple
Metal (or other) 3D printer. The intended use is for taking timelapses of
prints in OctoPrint / OctoPi.

# Build Instructions

Use OpenSCAD to turn this into an STL file, then use your favourite slicer to
turn that into GCODE and then whatever is your preferred method to feed that to
your 3D printer.

# Assembly and Usage

I designed this for a Logitech C310 and a Printrbot Simple Metal, but it will
probably work with other webcams in that range or that use a similar "balance
on the edge of your laptop screen" kind of mount. You just clip this thing to
the print bed using a bulldog clip, so it can probably work with lots of other
printers too.

The idea is to keep the printed object in the center, so the bed and extruder
and whatever else can move around, but the object being printed stays in focus.

Just strap the webcam to the bracket with some rubber bands to hold it firmly
in place, angle it to focus where you want and off you go.
